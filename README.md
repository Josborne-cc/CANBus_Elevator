The creation of an elevator with CAN-Bus and ethernet communication

Phase 1: This phase involved the design of a CAN Bus system for transfering data between each node

The nodes created were:

    Controller Node
    Elevator Car Node
    3 Floor Nodes
    PID Dummy node(to simulate the car movement before the elevator was built).

Each node uses an Axman development board with a core HCS12 processor.

Phase 4:

Notes on compilation for phase 1:
Code warrior ver. 5.1 was used.
Each node needs to be created as a separate project and the common libraries must be included in each of the respective projects.
