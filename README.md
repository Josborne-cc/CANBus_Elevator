# CANBus_Elevator
The creation of an elevator with CAN-Bus and ethernet communication

Phase 1:
This phase involved the design of a CAN Bus system for transfering data between each node

The nodes created were:
- Controller Node
- Elevator Car Node
- 3 Floor Nodes
- PID Dummy node(to simulate the car movement before the elevator was built).

Each node uses an Axman development board with a core HCS12 processor.
